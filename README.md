# Assignment Info:

### RUN:
* docker build . -t assignment
* docker run -p8123:8123 assignment



### Notes:
* No sample provided for pick_true and support_multiple when both are either true/false so thats why I prioritized pick_true as high
* For below input, the actual partial completed value is false because it has values and one of the value is valid, It has to be true only if all the values are not valid. But in the sample it was true.
